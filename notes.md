"In the last chapter, the formalism we used for defining the lexical grammar—the
rules for how characters get grouped into tokens—was called a regular language.
That was fine for our scanner, which emits a flat sequence of tokens. But
regular languages aren’t powerful enough to handle expressions which can nest
arbitrarily deeply."

"Recursion in the grammar is a good sign that the language being defined is
context-free instead of regular."
